Horiseon, Search Engine Optimization (Challenge 1)

Horiseon is a project that is focused on help provide information on how to optimize your website, and help accessibility. It is also showcases how important social media presence is, whether it be through marketing or just having a good image online. Having a well optimized website makes it easy for you to achieve your goal with your website, which in turn increases consumer happiness, which in turn helps growth.

Some struggles I had with this project involved my pathing issues I had at the start. I had messed up on my file location, which caused pathing issues. I also had a lot of trial and error on changing my CSS Classes, and ID's.

References used to help me with my code:

I used reference code to double check and compare my code, making sure that the code given had same/similar values for text size and etc.
For my href fix on 20, 23, 26, I used the reference code.
